Intro  

	As we begin to dive into these slings, keep in mind the overall theme and purpose is growth. An examination of who we are, who we want to be, and where we are in that process. These slings are not meant to fix or heal you, they just provide the space for you to do that yourself. Regardless of the invitation that you recieve, be it one that challenges your personal growth or one that challenges you to explore the world in ways you do not normally inhabit, approach each invitation with love, with kindness to yourself and the space around you, with an open heart and mind.

 If you find that the thing you are asked to do makes you uncomfortable, ask yourself where that uncomfort is coming from. If you find yourself rejecting what is being said or offered, ask where that rejection is coming from. If you find the voice of shame or voice of judgment being loud in your head, regardless if it is your voice or someone else's voice, ask yourself where that shame or judgment is coming from. We ask this question because when we know where it comes from we can better understand the way it lives in our body. We ask this question instead of asking "why" because “why” doesn’t get at the core of the feeling. The question of “why” has so many quick and defensive responses and nothing about what we are trying to do here is quick or defensive. 

If these thoughts or feelings do come, accept them, we are not in the business of denying emotions, and once you have acknowledged them start creating/developing/thinking of positive and affirming and accepting language and thoughts that you can attach to the topic. Even if it is forced at first. The more we practice finding those positive feeling and thoughts, the more accessible that avenue becomes. 

Also you have the choice to not engage with that invitation if you feel like where you are at the moment needs something else. Be true to yourself. Depending on the variation, you may not know what your invitation is until you are at your spot and do not have access to another one, at that point, if you choose to not engage with what is being asked, then ask yourself where that is coming from and write about that. 

More than anything, slinging is about intentionally checking in with yourself. It's about providing the space to think out loud and to validate those thoughts. It’s about using this time to ask a question and listen to yourself for the answer. It’s about reclaiming play as a tool for growth.

### Exploring your place/s

	There are a number of Explorations you may choose out of a bin. Once chosen, make sure you have all of the materials you need to complete your invitation. Head to your chosen place intentionally, allowing the invitation to inspire your sling there. Once there, engage with the invitation. On the sling back prepare how you plan on showcasing your exploration.

Create your own Adventure:

### Collect 

* Choose from bin 

* Collection does not need to happen physically, it could be in the form of writing or pictures

* Depending on the Documentation Method you choose, you could collect in that vein as well

### Method of Investigation 

* Choose from bin

* Allow this to be the way you dig deeper into your mode of investigation. Collecting isn't just a checklist or a bingo sheet, it is meant to collect your interaction. So use what you pull as a way to engage with what you are collecting in a deeper sense

### Documenting Method

* Choose from bin

* Allow this to influence how you approach your showcase
