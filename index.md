# About me 

Anthony Febo is a Puerto Rican artist from Lowell, MA. Febo lives at the intersection of poetry, theatre, performance art, mixed media, and education. With the help of his community, he created the slam poetry scene in the city that birthed and raised him. 

Febo's work explores what it means to actively choose joy in the face of what is trying to break you. He examines issues such as toxic masculinity, family and mental health, culture and identity, and the role representation plays into a personâ€™s development.  

# Program of Study

**How do routines impact your growth?**

The growth of the young person is at the heart of my Program of Study. Growth towards being a kinder, more compassionate, introspective/reflective, and creative feeler, thinker, and doer. This is done through the intentional debriefing of our current routines and the intentional creation of new ones.
